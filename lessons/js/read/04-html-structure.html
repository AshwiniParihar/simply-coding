      <h3>Basic HTML Document Structure:</h3>
      <p>
        Every HTML document follows a basic structure that defines how the
        content is organized and displayed in a web browser. Here is the
        typical structure of an HTML document:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
        <li>
          An HTML document consists of several key elements:
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
            <li>
              <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
              : Declares the document type and version of HTML. In this
              case, it specifies that the document is written in HTML5, the
              current standard.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
              : The root element of the document that wraps all other HTML
              elements. It indicates to the browser that this is an HTML
              document.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
              : Contains metadata (data about the document itself), such as
              the title that appears in the browser tab, links to external
              resources (CSS, JavaScript), and information for search
              engines.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
              : Contains all the visible content of the webpage, including
              text, images, links, forms, and other elements that the user
              interacts with.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Example: In the code editor, you can see a basic HTML page
          structure. Modify this structure to include your own content as
          you learn HTML.
        </li>
      </ul>
