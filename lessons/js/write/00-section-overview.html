      <h2>Welcome to your first Write Section!</h2>
      <p>
        The write section is designed for you to start writing code that
        relates to the lesson topic! There will be step-by-step instructions
        below that you can follow easily and write or adjust code in our
        built in code editor to the right! <br /><br />This is a place for
        you to write and expirment with concepts or topics we have learned
        about. Don't worry about making mistakes or trying something new,
        thats what this is about! If you get stuck or want to restart you
        can always click on
        <button
          class="editor-opt-btn"
          id="resetButton"
          onclick="resetCodeWithConfirmation()"
        >
          Reset Code
        </button>
        or just simply refresh the page. The code you write in our built in
        editor doesn't save, so before you move on make sure you are
        satisifed with what you have done.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Write:</h3>
      <p>
        You will be given a basic HTML page with some code! Follow the steps
        below to adjust the code and see how it affects the page. But before
        we begin, press
        <button class="editor-opt-btn" onclick="runCode()">Run Code</button>
        to see what the code written actually does! You will see the
        rendered code below the editor. <br />
        <br />
        <b> Note:</b> Don't worry yet about understanding everything that is
        going on, this is just a sample of HTML and what it can do! In later
        lessons we will cover everything you see here and more!
