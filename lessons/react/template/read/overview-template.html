        Welcome to the world of images in HTML! In this lesson, you'll learn how
        to enhance your webpages by adding images using the
        <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element. Images make websites more engaging,
        informative, and visually appealing.

      <!-- * Did You Know? Not required, but use this for a quick "this is an important topic and here is why" but keep it short -->
  
      <div class="alert alert-info mb-3">
        <strong>Did You Know?</strong> Images can be used to communicate complex
        ideas quickly and add visual context, improving user experience.
      </div>
      <!-- Other intro paragraphs, keep them short and around 2 paragraphs max, this is just the intro -->
      <p>
        Images are a crucial part of creating visually compelling websites. They
        convey information, evoke emotions, and provide context. A well-placed
        image can break up text, making content more digestible and attractive.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        In HTML, images are added using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element,
        which embeds an image into the page. This element is self-closing, meaning
        it doesnâ€™t require a separate closing tag.
      </p>
