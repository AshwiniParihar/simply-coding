                <p>Moving files from one folder to another helps you keep things organized. You can move files in multiple ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Drag and Drop</b>: Simply click and drag a file to the folder you want it moved to. You can drag it to the folder in the navigation pane or to a specific folder within the window.</li>
                    <li><b>Cut and Paste</b>: Right-click the file, select “Cut,” then navigate to the new folder and right-click, selecting “Paste.” You can also use the keyboard shortcuts `Ctrl + X` to cut and `Ctrl + V` to paste.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Avoid dragging files to random locations on your computer, as they can be hard to find later. Keep a consistent folder structure to make it easier to locate files.</p>
