                <p>Folders are like containers that hold files or other folders (called subfolders). Folders help you keep your files organized by grouping related files together. For example, you might have a folder called `Projects` that contains a subfolder for each coding project you’re working on.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To create a folder, right-click inside any area of File Explorer, select “New,” and then “Folder.” You can also use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + N` to quickly create a new folder.</li>
                    <li>When naming folders, use meaningful names that reflect the content inside. For example, use names like `HTML-Projects`, `Assignments`, or `Photos` instead of vague names like `Folder1`.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Plan your folder structure ahead of time! Think of how files will be stored long-term and create a hierarchy that makes sense (e.g., `Documents > Coding > HTML`).</p>
