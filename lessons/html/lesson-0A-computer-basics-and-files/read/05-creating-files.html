                <p>Creating new files is a basic but essential task for coders. You can create files in several ways depending on the file type you need. For instance, to create a simple text file:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Navigate to the folder where you want to create the file.</li>
                    <li>Right-click in the folder and select “New > Text Document” (or the file type you need).</li>
                    <li>Name your file and press `Enter` to save it. Double-click the file to open it and start editing.</li>
                    <li>When naming your file there are two parts to include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The name: <b>myfile</b></li>
                            <li>The extension: <b>.html</b></li>
                            <li>Full file name: <b>myfile.html</b></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always give your files clear and descriptive names. For example, instead of naming a file `test1.txt`, name it something like `ProjectDescription.txt` to make it easier to identify later.</p>
