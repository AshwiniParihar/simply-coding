                <p>Every file on your computer has a specific type, which tells the operating system and other programs what kind of data it holds. File types are indicated by their file extension (the part after the dot in the file name). Some common file types include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>.txt</strong>: Plain text file, great for notes or basic file creation. 
                        <br>Example: `notes.txt`, `to-do-list.txt`.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>.html</strong>: Hypertext Markup Language file, used to create webpages. 
                        <br>Example: `index.html`, `about-me.html`.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>.jpg/.png</strong>: Image files, used for photos and graphics. 
                        <br>Example: `profile-picture.jpg`, `logo.png`.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>.docx</strong>: Microsoft Word document. 
                        <br>Example: `resume.docx`, `project-report.docx`.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can change the file type when saving a file in most programs by selecting the format from a dropdown list. Be mindful of the file type you need when saving files, especially in coding, where using the correct file format (`.html`, `.css`, `.js`) is crucial for proper functionality.</p>
                <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Enable file extensions in File Explorer to easily see the file type. To do this, click on the <b>View</b> tab at the top of File Explorer, then check the box for “File name extensions.”</p>
