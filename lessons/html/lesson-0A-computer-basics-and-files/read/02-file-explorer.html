                <ul>
                    <li>Click the File Explorer icon on the taskbar (usually looks like a folder) or press `Windows + E` on your keyboard.</li>
                    <li>The left-hand side shows a <b>navigation pane</b>, which contains shortcuts to important areas like your Documents, Desktop ,User Name, and This PC (which displays all available drives).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You can quickly find a file by using the search bar at the top right of the File Explorer window. Type part of the file name, and it will filter results as you type.</p>
