                <p>Now that youâ€™ve practiced basic file management, try this challenge on your own. Follow these steps, but this time with minimal guidance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delete the `FirstRenamedFile.txt` file from your "CSS" folder.</li>
                    <li>Create a new folder called `JavaScript` inside your "Development" folder.</li>
                    <li>Inside the `JavaScript` folder, create a new text file. Add some text to the file, save it, and close it.</li>
                    <li>Move the new file to your `HTML` folder.</li>
                    <li>Rename the file to something meaningful (e.g., `ScriptFile.txt`).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you're done, double-check that the file has been moved and renamed correctly.</p>
