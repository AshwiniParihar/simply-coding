    Welcome! In this lesson, you'll learn about file paths in HTML, which are
    essential for linking to other files like images, CSS, JavaScript, and
    documents. A proper understanding of file paths allows you to organize and
    access resources correctly within your projects.

    <strong>Did You Know?</strong> File paths are like directions that tell the
    browser where to find files, enabling your website to load the correct
    resources.

  <h4>Types of File Paths</h4>
  <p>In HTML, there are two primary types of file paths:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Absolute Path:</strong> An absolute path points to the exact
      location of a file on the internet or on your computer. On the internet
      they usually start with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>.
      <br /><strong>Example:</strong>
      <code>https://example.com/images/logo.png</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Relative Path:</strong> A relative path points to a file's
      location relative to the current file's directory. <br /><strong
        >Example:</strong
      >
      <code>../images/logo.png</code> (moves up one level to find the "images"
      folder).
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
