      <h2>Create</h2>
      <h3 class="styled-heading">This is our favorite section!</h3>
      <p>
        The read and write sections are to get you read for the create
        section! This section is where you apply with minimal guidance what
        you have learned so far!
      </p>
      <h4>
        The only way to learn to code is to...
        <span class="styled-heading">CODE!</span>
      </h4>
      <p>
        You have to build projects and web pages on your own, experimene,
        fail, learn, and eventually succeed. This is the process to become
        an expert coder.
      </p>
      <p>
        The create section is where we get to do this! The challenges here
        will give you guidance on what to do, but "the how" will be up to you!
        Later on we will also introduce full scale projects instead of
        smaller challenges to build some really great things you can start
        adding into your portfolio!
      </p>

      <h3>What We Will Create:</h3>
      <p>
        We have provided the skeleton for an HTML in our built-in code
        editor.
      </p>
      <h3>Your Goal:</h3>
      <p>
        Your goal is to add back in some tags you saw in the
        <code>write</code> section.
