        Before you check out the solution do your best in all the lessons
        to create your own code first!
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the resources you have available to find the answers on how to
        do something before you check out the solution code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Remember:</b> In coding there are multiple solutions to the same
        problem. If you come up with a different solution that also works
        then that is also correct!
      </p>
      <h3>
        Below is an example of how you could have written your code for this
        create challenge:
      </h3>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Amazing Webpage&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, Future Web Developer!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are about to create your first web page! Let's start by learning the basics of HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTML is the backbone of web development. You'll use it to structure all your web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>
        <b>From the Instructor:</b> The best part of coding is there often
        isn't any right or wrong answers, just good, better and best
        answers. Just keep working and growing your skills to get better!
      </p>
      <p>
        Experiment with the code, try new things, break stuff. When you have
        had enough, move on to our next lesson where we will deep dive into
        specific topics and lessons and learn more about what we saw in
        our <b>Intro To HTML</b> lesson!
