          <strong>HTML</strong> (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard
          language used to create the structure and content of web pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          It provides the basic building blocks for web development,
          organizing text, images, links, and multimedia into a structured
          layout.
        </li>
        <li>
          Web browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Brave interpret
          HTML to display content properly. Browsers read HTML code and
          render the page based on its structure and tags.
        </li>
        <li>
          HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements such
          as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Tags give meaning to
          the content and help browsers interpret it correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          The structure of an HTML document begins with the
          <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag and contains sections like
          <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> (metadata) and
          <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> (visible content).
        </li>
        <li>
          HTML is a static language, meaning it defines the structure and
          content but does not provide interactivity. CSS and JavaScript are
          used alongside HTML to create a fully functional website.
        </li>
        <li>
          HTML5, the latest version, introduced new semantic elements like
          <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and
          multimedia support with <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and
          <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tags.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accessibility is a key aspect of HTML. Using semantic tags
          improves accessibility by helping assistive technologies like
          screen readers understand the content.
        </li>
        <li>
          HTML forms capture user input through elements like text boxes,
          checkboxes, and radio buttons. This input is typically processed
          by a server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Understanding HTML is the foundation for learning CSS (for design)
          and JavaScript (for functionality), making it the first step
          toward becoming a web developer.

      <h3>The Role of HTML</h3>
      <p>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) serves as the backbone of every
        website. It defines the structure and layout of web content,
        creating the foundation upon which all other elements are built.
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px">
        <li>
          HTML organizes content into headings, paragraphs, lists, images,
          and other elements, forming the visible structure of a webpage.
        </li>
        <li>
          It provides a semantic structure, making content easier to
          understand for users, search engines, and assistive technologies.
        </li>
        <li>
          While HTML handles the basic structure, CSS and JavaScript enhance
          the design and functionality of the webpage.
        </li>
      </ul>
