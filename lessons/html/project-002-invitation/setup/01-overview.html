      In the Setup section you will get your file and folder structure and
      initial code to begin and succesfully complete your project.

      <strong>Remember:</strong> There is no "solution code" for our projects.
      We view our projects two ways.
      <ol>
        <li>
          When a client wants a project done, generally it will start with only
          an idea or design. Creating the code, that is your job. It's why
          <strong>YOU</strong> will be making the big <strong>$$</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          These projects are meant to be the start of your professional
          portfolio. So how you create them is up to you. It is how you will
          learn and be able to prove you can build webpages.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <i class="text-muted" style="font-size: smaller">
        Don't worry if you can't complete the project 100% initially. You can
        always revisit your project and make changes later when you learn more!
        Coding is a continuous process.
