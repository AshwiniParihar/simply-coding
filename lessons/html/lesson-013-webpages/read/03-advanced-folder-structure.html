    <h2>Project Structure Theory</h2>
    <p>
      Creating a consistent and logical file structure is essential in web
      development. Well-organized projects are easier to navigate, maintain, and
      scale, especially as they grow in complexity. By grouping similar files
      together, you reduce the risk of confusion and make it simpler for others
      (and yourself) to find and update specific files.

    <h3>Why Structure Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Structuring your project is more than just organization – it's about
      efficiency, collaboration, and scalability. With a clear structure,
      developers can quickly locate files, and updates become straightforward.
      When multiple people work on a project, a consistent structure reduces the
      learning curve and avoids mistakes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Easily find files and make updates.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Allows team members to understand and
        follow the same file organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scalability:</strong> A structured project can expand with more
        features without becoming chaotic.
      </li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Feature-Based Structure</h3>
        <p>
          A feature-based structure groups files by features or components,
          making it easy to isolate and manage each part of the project. This is
          commonly used in complex projects with distinct parts.

        <h3>File Type-Based Structure</h3>
        <p>
          This structure organizes files by type, grouping HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and other resources in separate folders. It's helpful in
          smaller projects where files are limited in number.

    <!-- MVC (Model-View-Controller) Structure Card -->
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 mb-4 border rounded">
      <div class="infographic-section">
        <h3>MVC (Model-View-Controller) Structure</h3>
        <p>
          MVC is a widely-used structure in frameworks like React and Angular.
          It separates the code into Models (data), Views (UI), and Controllers
          (business logic). This structure is ideal for larger projects with
          complex data flows.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
📂 my-website/
├── 📂 models/
│   ├── 📄 userModel.js
│   └── 📄 productModel.js
├── 📂 views/
│   ├── 📄 home.html
│   ├── 📄 about.html
│   └── 📄 contact.html
└── 📂 controllers/
    ├── 📄 homeController.js
    └── 📄 productController.js
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          <strong>Benefits:</strong> Separates concerns, making the project
          easier to manage and scale.

  <!-- Additional Project Structures Section -->
  <div class="infographic-section">
    <h3>Other Common Project Structures</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to the structures discussed, you may come across other ways to
      organize projects:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Domain-Driven Structure:</strong> Organizes files based on the
        domain or area of the application, making it easy to navigate large,
        multi-functional applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layered Structure:</strong> Separates code by layers, such as
        presentation, business logic, and data access. This structure is
        typically seen in back-end development.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Atomic Design Structure:</strong> Often used in design systems
        and UI-heavy applications, this approach breaks UI components into
        atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages for reusable design.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Monorepo Structure:</strong> A single repository (monorepo)
        holds multiple applications or services, which may use similar files,
        packages, and code libraries.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Different organizations and companies work with different structures, so
      learning about them and being familiar is a good idea!
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Pro Tip Section -->
  <div class="tip-box">
    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Choose a structure that suits your project needs.
    In small projects, file type-based organization might work best, but for
    larger projects, consider a more modular approach like feature-based or MVC.
    In this course, we will stick to a file type-based structure, but feel free
    to experiment and try new things out!
