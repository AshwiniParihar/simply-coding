        In this challenge, you will create your very own "About Me" page from
        scratch! You will apply everything you've learned so far, including HTML
        structure, headings, paragraphs, word processing tags, and self-closing
        tags. By the end, you’ll have a complete web page showcasing your
        interests, hobbies, and unique personality.
