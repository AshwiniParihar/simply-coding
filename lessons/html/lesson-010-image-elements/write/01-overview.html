  <h2>Putting It into Practice</h2>
  <p>
    Now that you've explored the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and its
    attributes, it's time to put your knowledge to use! In this section, you
    will follow step-by-step instructions to create a webpage that incorporates
    the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element with various attributes and styling.
  </p>
  <p>
    You’ll start by adding a simple image and then progressively enhance it
    using different attributes like <code>src</code>, <code>alt</code>,
    <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>title</code>. By the end
    of this section, you'll have hands-on experience building with the image tag
    and understand how to use it effectively in different scenarios.
