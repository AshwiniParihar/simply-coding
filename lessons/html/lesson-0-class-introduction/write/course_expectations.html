      <h3>Attendance & Participation</h3>
      <p>
        Attendance is required for all scheduled classes. If you must miss a
        class for call outs or anything else, when possible please inform the
        instructor. We will try to help you catch back up on lab days when
        needed. Participate actively in discussions, group projects, and coding
        exercises. This will help reinforce your learning and understanding of
        the material. While this class is instructor-led, the main
        responsibility lands on the student to learn, apply, and grow. This
        class will be different from any other you have done. You have to decide
        to educate yourself inside and outside of class to be successful.
      </p>

      <h3>Assignment & Project Submission</h3>
      <p>
        Complete all assigned exercises, challenges, and projects by the due
        dates. Late submissions may be accepted with prior approval but may
        affect your overall grade. Capstone projects should reflect your
        understanding of the topics covered and be presented professionally.
      </p>

      <h3>Classroom Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        Leave any outside drama at the door. Come to class prepared to focus on
        learning and making progress. We have minimal teaching time. Let’s make
        use of our time appropriately. Respectful and professional behavior is
        expected at all times. Disruptions, inappropriate language, or any form
        of disrespect will not be tolerated. Collaboration and teamwork are
        encouraged, but plagiarism is strictly prohibited. Any copied work will
        result in a review of your standing in the course. We will discuss this
        in class further, in coding the expectation is different than in other
        courses. Zero tolerance for complaining. This course is tough. Expect
        that from day one. YOU CAN DO IT, work hard, and remember you can
        succeed. You have to choose to be successful and learn in this course.
      </p>

      <h3>Appropriate Use of Lab Time</h3>
      <p>
        Lab time should be used for self-study, project work, and test
        preparation. Make sure to use this time effectively to stay on track
        with the course content and projects.
      </p>

      <h3>Earned Certificates</h3>
      <p>
        You will have the opportunity to test and earn 3 different certificates
        that will help prove your knowledge and prepare you for a career in web
        development.

      <h3>Grading Scale</h3>
      <p>
        Your overall grade will be a mix of participation, attendance, and
        submitted coding projects and assignments. You will be graded against
        your effort and your improvement. A passing grade will also qualify you
        for our completion certificate for our course. This is a valuable
        credential to show future employers of your education and dedication in
        becoming a world-class web developer.
