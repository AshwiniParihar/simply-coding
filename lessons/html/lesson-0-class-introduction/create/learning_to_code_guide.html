      <h3>Welcome to the World of Coding!</h3>
      <p>
        Coding is both an art and a science, where logic meets creativity.
        Here’s a guide to help you navigate the process of learning to code:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Start Small, Think Big</h3>
      <p>
        <b> Begin with the Basics:</b> Before diving into complex concepts, make
        sure you have a strong foundation in basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        Don’t rush; understanding the fundamentals will make advanced topics
        easier. Build Incrementally: Start with small projects, like creating a
        simple webpage, then gradually add more features. This helps you see
        your progress and stay motivated.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Practice, Practice, Practice</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Code Daily:</b> Like any skill, coding improves with practice. Try to
        write code every day, even if it’s just for 10-15 minutes. Solve
        Problems: Use coding challenges and exercises to test your
        understanding. Websites like LeetCode, Codewars, and HackerRank offer a
        range of problems to solve.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Don’t Be Afraid to Fail</h3>
      <p>
        <b> Debugging is Learning:</b> Errors are part of the process. When you
        encounter a bug, take it as an opportunity to learn. Use console logs
        (console.log) in JavaScript to track the flow of your code and identify
        where things go wrong. <br /><b>Use Comments:</b> Comment your code to
        explain what each part does. This not only helps others understand your
        code but also helps you recall your thought process when you review your
        work later.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
// This function adds 2 numbers
    function addNumbers(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
           </code> </pre>

      <h3>4. Understand, Don’t Memorize</h3>
      <p>
        <b> Concept Over Code:</b> Focus on understanding why the code works,
        not just how to write it. Memorizing code snippets won’t be as
        beneficial as understanding the underlying concepts. Ask Questions:
        Whether you’re stuck or curious, don’t hesitate to ask questions.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Learn from Others</h3>
      <p>
        <b> Read Code:</b> Explore code written by others. GitHub is a goldmine
        of open-source projects where you can see how experienced developers
        structure their code. Pair Programming: If possible, work with a coding
        partner. Discussing and explaining your code to someone else reinforces
        your understanding.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Stay Updated</h3>
      <p>
        <b> Keep Learning:</b> Technology evolves quickly. Follow coding blogs,
        attend webinars, and take advanced courses to keep your skills sharp.
        Explore Documentation: Get comfortable reading official documentation,
        such as MDN Web Docs, to understand the latest standards and best
        practices.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Build Real Projects</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Apply What You Learn:</b> The best way to solidify your knowledge is
        by building real-world projects. Start with simple websites and
        gradually move to more complex applications. Create a Portfolio:
        Document your projects in a portfolio. Not only does this showcase your
        skills, but it also gives you something tangible to review your
        progress.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Consistency</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Incremental Progress:</b> Coding isn’t something you can learn
        overnight. Often a topic we learn in class you will not understand that
        day. Your goal will be to just get 1% better everyday. Consistent
        learning will make you far more successful than speed learning for a
        short period of time.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Master Yourself</h3>
      <p>
        <b> Mindset:</b> Our biggest enemy in learning or succeeding often is
        ourselves. Coding is no different. Don’t allow doubts or complaints to
        get in the way of progress. At times the progress may seem non-existent
        or small. That’s ok. Keep going. Allow yourself grace in learning
        something new. Don’t complain, and don’t give up. Whether you tell
        yourself you can or can’t you will be right.
