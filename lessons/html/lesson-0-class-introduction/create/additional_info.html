        The built-in code editor is a fantastic tool that helps us learn and
        experiment with code quickly. However, it’s important to remember that
        it is not a replacement for our primary editor,
        <strong>VS Code</strong>, which we’ll dive into soon!
      </p>
      <p>
        One key thing to note: any code you write in the built-in editor will be
        lost if you navigate away from the tab, page or refresh it. To keep your
        work, you’ll need to save it in VS Code by creating and storing it in
        files. Don’t worry, we’ll guide you through how to do that in an
        upcoming lesson!
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, keep in mind that the built-in code editor is still in its beta
        version. That means it’s under development, and you might encounter bugs
        or things that don’t work quite as expected. If you run into any issues,
        let us know right away, and we’ll work to fix them as soon as possible!

        Lastly, what you see, use, and interact with in these lessons is built
        entirely using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> — the very same languages you’re learning!
        As you progress through the lessons, you’ll gain the skills to create
        similar projects and websites yourself.
