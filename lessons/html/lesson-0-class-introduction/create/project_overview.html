        Projects are a key part of this course and offer you the chance to apply
        everything you’ve learned in a practical, hands-on way. Each project is
        designed to challenge your understanding, encourage problem-solving, and
        help you think creatively while building real-world solutions.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Guided Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the course, you’ll work on guided projects that align with
        specific lessons. These projects will walk you through the development
        process step-by-step, reinforcing the concepts you’ve learned in class
        while providing a structured environment to practice your coding skills.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Capstone Projects</h3>
      <p>
        The capstone projects are larger, more comprehensive assignments where
        you’ll have the opportunity to showcase your skills. These projects will
        test your ability to independently plan, code, and execute a full
        project, incorporating the various web development skills you've
        acquired.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Personal Projects</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to the guided and capstone projects, you'll also be
        encouraged to start personal projects of your own. These projects allow
        you to explore your own ideas and interests, giving you creative freedom
        to experiment and build something unique.
      </p>

      <p>
        Projects not only help you solidify your understanding but also serve as
        a portfolio to demonstrate your abilities to potential employers. Make
        sure to document your work, as each project is a valuable step in your
        journey to becoming a web developer.
