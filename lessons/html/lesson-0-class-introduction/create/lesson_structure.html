      <p>
        Each lesson is divided into four main sections:<br />
        <strong>Overview</strong>, <strong>Read</strong>,
        <strong>Write</strong>, and <strong>Create</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>Overview</strong> section gives you a broad understanding of
        the lesson's focus. It highlights the key topics and objectives you’ll
        be covering, giving you a roadmap of what to expect. This sets the stage
        for your learning and helps you mentally prepare for the content ahead.
        This section may also contain video content to help you understand the
        topics better.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Read</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>Read</strong> section introduces new concepts and
        information. This part is designed to explain the core material,
        offering clear explanations, examples, and supporting details. It's your
        opportunity to absorb the theory and gather knowledge before moving on
        to practical applications.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Write</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>Write</strong> section puts your knowledge into action.
        Here, you'll follow a guided, step-by-step process to complete a small
        project or exercise based on the lesson’s content. The goal is to
        reinforce what you’ve learned by applying it in a structured way,
        helping you build confidence and understanding. This will usually be
        done in the built in code editor to the right.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Create</h3>
      <p>
        In the <strong>Create</strong> section, you’ll take your learning a step
        further by working on a personal project. You’ll be given more freedom
        to apply your understanding creatively, designing something unique while
        integrating the concepts from the lesson. This is where you can add your
        personal touch and think beyond the instructions.
      </p>

      <p>
        This four-part structure ensures that you first understand the material,
        then practice it in a guided setting, and finally apply it creatively in
        your own project. Each step is designed to deepen your knowledge and
        enhance your coding skills.
