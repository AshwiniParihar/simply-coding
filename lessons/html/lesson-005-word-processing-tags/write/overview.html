      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        In this lesson, you will apply various word processing tags in HTML to
        format a block of text. The starter code provides basic HTML structure,
        and youâ€™ll progressively enhance it by adding different tags to change
        the appearance and meaning of the text. The steps will guide you through
        each modification, explaining both semantic and non-semantic tags.
