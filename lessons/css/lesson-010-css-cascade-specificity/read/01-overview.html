      In this lesson, you will learn about the CSS cascade, which is an essential concept in CSS. CSS is used to style HTML elements, and the cascade is the rule that determines how styles are applied when multiple CSS rules target the same element. Understanding how CSS cascade works will help you manage and organize your styles effectively, ensuring that the right styles are applied to elements.
