      <strong>Why Do We Need CSS? </strong>
      Using CSS helps maintain cleaner HTML files by separating content from presentation, which prevents clutter and simplifies code maintenance. 
    </p>

    <p>
      It promotes modularity and reusability, allowing defined styles to be applied consistently across multiple elements or pages. This separation of concerns enhances code maintainability and scalability by clearly distinguishing structure (HTML) from styling (CSS).
